[3] After logging in, the main interface displays welcome information, shortcut entries for system modules, and an overview of pending tasks, new consultations, and responses. Quick navigation links allow access to modules such as **Slide Upload & Viewing**, **AI Analysis Q&A**, and **Data Statistics**.
